- Hi my name is Joshua Perry.
  Currently I am studying for my Bachelors in Computer Science at WGU Online.
  I've completed some basic HTML and CSS study on my own via FreeCodeCamp & TheOdinProject.
  
- My prior education and work experience include:
  - A Bachelors in Marine Engineering Operations from Maine Maritime Academy.
  - A USCG Unlimited Third Engineer License.
  - Worked onborad the Deepwater Conqueror Ultra-Deepwater Drillship as a Third Engineer.
  - Worked as a plant operator for Rawhide Unit 1.
 
- I hope my previous experiences alongside my future education will open opportunites to work alongside these industries.
