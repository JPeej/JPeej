- Hi my name is Joshua Perry.
  Currently I am learning programming through FreeCodeCamp and will hopefully be studying for a Bachelors in Computer Science soon.
  
- My progress in FreeCodeCamp:
  - Responsive Web Development complete. Includes basics of HTML and CSS.
  
- My prior education and work experience include:
  - A Bachelors in Marine Engineering Operations from Maine Maritime Academy.
  - A USCG Unlimited Third Engineer License.
  - Worked onborad the Deepwater Conqueror Ultra-Deepwater Drillship as a Third Engineer.
  - Worked as a plant operator for Rawhide Unit 1.
 
- I hope my previous experiences alongside my future education will open opportunites to work alongside these industries.
